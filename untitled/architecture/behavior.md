# Behavior

## Overview

**Behavior** modules is a heart of the whole application. It consists of tons of action creators, thunk actions, various middleware and [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) epics. Any action triggered during the application run-time will eventually be handled by one these entities.

All business logic, all user actions handling and all side-effects management reside within this module. It acts as a [Front Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_controller) for the whole application.
